What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?  List and explain at least FOUR advantages in using a CDN.
A CDN is a distribution system that gives content to users very efficiently and at a high quality.
One advantage is that even if you are far away from your server CDNs have data centers that help with 
faster downloads.  Another advantage is CDNs reduce the load time of a website which is very important 
to any user because a slow page can be unattractive.  A huge benefit of using a CDN is a more secure network.
Security is important for any server and the users that work with it.  The last benefit I chose is the ability to 
attract more customers.  Customers are more satisfied by how efficient the page works making others want to use it as well.
